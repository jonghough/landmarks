# Landmarks - Tokyo Tech Companies

Visualization of Tokyo tech company locations segmented by market. This application gives a 3D map visualization of the offices of hundreds of Tokyo based tech companies.

## Purpose

Mainly this is a demonstration of rendering 3D scenes using xyz tiles, and other data, using BabylonJS. Tokyo was chosen as a city somewhat arbitrarily, and companies and market segments as a domain also arbitrarily. Could have used historic sites, tourist locations etc etc.

## Definition of a tech company

Here, the definition is broad and vague. Basically whatever seems is doing something interesting, innovative, or impressive with computer technology, or is known to have large IT or tech departments. The list is not exhaustive, and there are likely to be many glaring omissions. The list is heavy on the side of start ups and some lesser known tech companies.

## Technology used to create the app

- BablyonJS
- Vue 3
- Nuxt 3
- Vuetify

## Tiling

Various xyz tiles are able to be used as a background tiling scheme. By default Google Terrain tiles are used.

## Locations

The locations of the companies are their Tokyo HQ offices. These addresses and latitude, longitude coordinates are best effort. There is a chance some are incorrect. Best efforts have been made to use correct locations.

## Market segments

Companies are given market segments in which their main businesses operate. This is also best effort, as segmenting companies by markets is often not easy.
